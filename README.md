# Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb
### In this project, I am conducting my own data analysis by taking a look at the datasets of [No-Show Appointments] and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it.
### Then I was using pandas and NumPy in Jupyter notebook to answer the questions I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.

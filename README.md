# Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb
### In this project, I am conducting my own data analysis by taking a look at the datasets of [No-Show Appointments]. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
### Then I was brainstorming what questions I could answer using it such as:
1. What is the most independent factors that affect the showing of the patients?
2. Does the age affect the showing of the patients?
3. Does the SMS_recevied affect the showing of the patients?
4. Does the gender affect the showing of the patients?
5. Does the Neighbourhood affect the showing of the patients?

### Then I was using pandas and NumPy in Jupyter notebook to answer the questions I am most interested in, check for cleanliness and trim the dataset for analysis.
### Finally I was making general histograms to illustrate the datasetand and creating a report sharing all the insights.
